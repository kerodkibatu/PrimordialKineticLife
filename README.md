# Primordial Kinetic Life Simulation

![Demo](demo.gif)

Primordial Kinetic life is a fascinating simulation project that replicates the emergence of life using kinetic particles. It offers an interactive experience to explore the beauty of self-organization and adaptation using simple(pssibly asymmetrical) laws of attraction and repulsion.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C#
- Graphics Library: Raylib
- User Interface: ImGui

## Features

- Mesmerizing kinetic particle simulations.
- Interactive controls for altering simulation parameters.
- Captivating visual representation of early life forms.
- Real-time rendering and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

## Installation

### Method 1: Cloning and Running Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kerodkibatu/PrimordialKineticLife.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd PrimordialKineticLife
   ```

3. **Run the Project**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```
   
   This will build and run the project locally on your machine.

### Method 2: Using a Released Version

1. **Go to the Releases Section**

   Head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/kerodkibatu/PrimordialKineticLife/releases) section of this repository.
