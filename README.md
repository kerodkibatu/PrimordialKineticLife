# Primordial Kinetic Life Simulation

![Demo](demo.gif)

Primordial Kinetic life is a fascinating simulation project that replicates the emergence of life using kinetic particles. It offers an interactive experience to explore the beauty of self-organization and adaptation using simple(pssibly asymmetrical) laws of attraction and repulsion.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C#
- Graphics Library: Raylib
- User Interface: ImGui

## Features

- Mesmerizing kinetic particle simulations.
- Interactive controls for altering simulation parameters.
- Captivating visual representation of early life forms.
- Real-time rendering and user-friendly interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
